# DMXAdapter
This is a ESP32 based adapter for wireless transmission of DMX.
It is able to read and transmit DMX signals and communicates with ESPNow, a low latency protocol developed by Espressif.
To manage the settings it provides a WiFi access point and a web UI and REST API.

## Web-UI
Access the Web-UI by accessing it under e.g. [http://192.168.4.1/](http://192.168.4.1/)
